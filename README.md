## AI Assistance Disclosure

This project was developed with assistance from generative AI tools:

- **Tool**: ChatGPT-4o
- **Dates**: Febuary 10th, 2026
- **Scope**: Group Contacts based on their names.
- **Use**: Generated a function used to group contacts by the first name using the prompt — needed a JavaScript function to store contacts into seperate groups based on the first letter of their first name. For example, Donald and Dwight fall into group D while Jonathan goes under group J

Lines 217 to 222 of contacts.js was derived from ChatGPT's response
